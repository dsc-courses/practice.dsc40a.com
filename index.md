This site contains practice problems taken from old DSC 40A exams. We‚Äôve organized problems in two ways:

1. By **topic**. This makes it easy to practice old exam problems by topic.
1. By **old exam**. This makes it easy to simulate taking an entire exam.

In all cases, you should work on these problems on paper, since your exams will also be on paper. Even though you will see some multiple choice bubbles, you intentionally cannot select them.

**Note that this site is new for Spring 2024; problems will be added regularly.**
