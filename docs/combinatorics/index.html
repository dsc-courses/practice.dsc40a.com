<p>You roll a 12-sided die 8 times.</p>

<h3 id="problem-1.1">Problem 1.1</h3>
<p>What is the probability you roll 8 distinct values?</p>

\dfrac{12}{12}\cdot\dfrac{11}{12}\cdot\dfrac{10}{12}\cdot\dots\cdot\dfrac{5}{12}</span></p>
<p>There’s two ways you can think of this problem.</p>
<p>The numerator <span class="math inline">{12 \choose 8}\cdot8!</span>
is the number of total possible permutations of 8 distinct values; <span class="math inline">{12 \choose 8}</span> possible sets of 8 distinct
values times <span class="math inline">8!</span> orderings, because the
die could roll the same set of distinct values in <span class="math inline">8!</span> different ways. The denominator <span class="math inline">12^8</span> is the number of total possible
outcomes. Altogether, dividing the numerator by the denominator gives us
the probability of rolling 8 distinct values.</p>
<p>We can also solve this problem differently by realizing that the
rolls are independent. In the first roll the probability of getting a
new number is 1 (since any number would be new), now in the second roll
the probability of getting a new number is <span class="math inline">\frac{11}{12}</span> since we’ve only rolled one
number so rolling any of the other 11 numbers would be rolling a new
number.If you keep doing this for each roll, and multiply the
independent probabilities of getting a new number in each of the rolls
you’ll get <span class="math inline">\dfrac{12}{12}\cdot\dfrac{11}{12}\cdot\dfrac{10}{12}\cdot\dots\cdot\dfrac{5}{12}</span></p>

<h3 id="problem-1.2">Problem 1.2</h3>
<p>What is the probability you roll exactly 7 distinct values?</p>

<p><span class="math inline">\dfrac{{8 \choose 2}\cdot{12 \choose
7}\cdot7!}{12^8}</span></p>
<p>Again, I’m going to show you two different ways you can think of this
problem. We can get the total number of outcomes that get you exactly 7
distinct values by doing the following, first choose 7 from the 12
possible numbers (there’s <span class="math inline">{12 \choose
7}</span> ways to do it), then choose a number to duplicate (there’s
<span class="math inline">{7 \choose 1}</span> ways to do that), lastly
you need to order them. From the 8 possible places you have availible
you need to choose 2 for the repeated value (there’s <span class="math inline">{8 \choose 2}</span> ways to do that), then once you
chose a placement for your reapeted value you need to choose one for
each of the remaing 6 values(there’s <span class="math inline">6!</span>
ways to do that). Finally just multiply the different ways you can
perform each of those actions and you’ll get the number of ways you can
roll 7 different values <span class="math display">\begin{align*}
{12 \choose 7}\cdot{7 \choose 1}\cdot{8 \choose 2}\cdot6! = {8 \choose
2}\cdot{12 \choose 7}\cdot7!
\end{align*}</span></p>
<p>lastly, just divide by the total number of possible outcomes and you
get <span class="math inline">\dfrac{{8 \choose 2}\cdot{12 \choose
7}\cdot7!}{12^8}</span></p>
<p>You could also find the number of rolls with exactly 7 different
values by doing the following. First, select an ordered string of size 7
from the 12 possible values (there’s <span class="math inline">{12
\choose 7}\cdot7!</span> ways to do that), then take the first value of
the string as the duplicated value and keep the others as they are, now
you only need to place 2 copies of the repeated value somewhere on your
string of 6 numbers (there’s <span class="math inline">{8 \choose
2}</span> ways to do that), multiply this the ways you can do these two
actions and divide by total number of outcomes and you’ll get <span class="math inline">\dfrac{{8 \choose 2}\cdot{12 \choose
7}\cdot7!}{12^8}</span> This solution is faster but less intuitive.</p>

<p><i>Source: <a href="../sp23-final-pt2/index.html">Spring 2023 Final
Part 2</a>, Problem 4</i></p>
<p>At Panda Express, there are <span class="math inline">18</span> items
available on the menu. Food is served on plates that are divided into
three equal sections, and all sections of the plate must contain exactly
one menu item.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h3 id="problem-2.1">Problem 2.1</h3>
<p>Suppose each section of the plate is a different color (in a
clockwise order around the plate, the sections are red, yellow, blue).
How many different-looking plates of food can be created, if we must
have three different menu items on the plate?</p>
<p>One example plate of food has Honey Walnut Shrimp in the red section,
Kung Pao Chicken in the yellow section, and brown rice in the blue
section.</p>

<header id="title-block-header">
<h1 class="title"> </h1>
</header>
<p><span class="math inline">{18 \choose 3} \cdot 3!</span></p>
<p>This problem is exactly asking for the number of permutations of
three elements from a pool of 18 elements, which is <span class="math display">\begin{align*}
18\cdot17\cdot16 = \frac{18!}{15!} = {18 \choose 3} \cdot 3!
\end{align*}</span></p>
<p>You should remember that whenever you draw items <strong>without
replacement</strong> and the <strong>order matters</strong> then you are
calculating a permutation. Alternatively, you can reason that in the red
segment of the plate, you can have any of the 18 different menu items,
then for the yellow segment you only have 17 menu items available, since
the red already has one, lastly you have 16 items left for the blue part
of the plate. Then just multiply all the ways you can choose menu items
for each segment getting a total of <span class="math display">\begin{align*}
18\cdot17\cdot16 = {18 \choose 3} \cdot 3!

<h3 id="problem-2.2">Problem 2.2</h3>
<p>Suppose each section of the plate is a different color (in a

How many different-looking plates of food can be created, if we are

<p>In this question, since we are allowed to repeat menu items, we have
18 options for each of the sections of the plate. Then when you multiply
all the ways you can choose items for a secyion of the plate you get
<span class="math inline">18\cdot18\cdot18 = 18^3</span>. Similarly to
how we explained the question before this one, aske your self if the
drawing process has replacement and if the order matters. In this case
you’ll find that <strong>we have replacement</strong> and <strong>we
also have ordeirng</strong>, so this is a sequence, and the number of
sequence’s of lenght k from a pool of n elements is <span class="math inline">n^k</span>.</p>

<h3 id="problem-2.3">Problem 2.3</h3>
<p>Suppose each section of the plate is the same color (white). How many
different-looking plates of food can be created, if we must have three
different menu items on the plate?</p>
<p>One example plate of food has, in a clockwise order around the plate,
Eggplant Tofu, Broccoli Beef, and fried rice. This is the same plate as
the one that has, in a clockwise order, Broccoli Beef, fried rice, and
Eggplant Tofu, because one plate can be rotated to look like the other
(this counts as the same.)</p>
<div id="accordionExample" class="accordion">
<div class="accordion-item">
<h2 class="accordion-header" id="heading2_3">

<div id="collapse2_3" class="accordion-collapse collapse"

<div class="accordion-body">
<header id="title-block-header">
<h1 class="title"> </h1>
</header>
<p><span class="math inline">2 \cdot {18 \choose 3}</span></p>
<p>Similarly to how we solved the previous problems, we are going to
deconstruct the process of building a plate with the given
characteristics. First, we know that any plate must have three items, so
let’s start by choosing three items from the 18 menu items we have
available (we have <span class="math inline">{18 \choose 3}</span> ways
to do that).</p>
<p>Now once you chose the menu items that go on your plate, you need to
arange them on your plate, normally if we are aranging three distinct
elements on a line we know that there’s <span class="math inline">3!</span> ways to do that, unfortunately like we saw
in the prompt of this problem we need to account for when we rotate the
plate. In the prompt it was signaled that the plate with Eggplant Tofu,
Broccoli Beef, and fried rice in clockwise order around the plate, is
the same as the plate with Broccoli Beef, fried rice, and Eggplant Tofu
(also in clockwise order), this happens because if you rotate your fisrt
plate in counter clockwise direction then you would get the second
plate, and in fact we could do this again to show those two plates are
the same as the plate with fried rice, Eggplant Tofu, and Broccoli Beef.
If you were to do the rotation again you would get the original plate,
so for any specific plate we can find three different lines that
describe the same plate, thus if we divide the number of ways to order
our 3 menu items on a line(<span class="math inline">3!</span>) by 3, we
should get the number of different plates we can build with any three
items, so <span class="math inline">\frac{3!}{3} = 2</span></p>
<p>Finally we only need to mutiply the number of ways we can choose
three menu items by the number of plates we can build with those three
items getting <span class="math inline">2 \cdot {18 \choose
3}</span>.</p>

<h3 id="problem-2.4">Problem 2.4</h3>
<p>Suppose each section of the plate is the same color (white). Now we’d
like to consider what happens if we can have the same food in multiple
sections. What do we need to <strong>add to 4.3’s answer</strong> to get
the number of different-looking plates of food that can be created, if
we are allowed to have the same food in multiple sections?</p>
<p>As before, two plates that can be rotated to look like one another
count as the same.</p>
<div id="accordionExample" class="accordion">
<div class="accordion-item">
<h2 class="accordion-header" id="heading2_4">

<header id="title-block-header">
<h1 class="title"> </h1>
</header>
<p><span class="math inline">2 \cdot {18 \choose 2} + {18 \choose
1}</span></p>
<p>Now that we are allowed to repeat menu items we need to consider the
2 new types of plates, type 1 a plate with the same menu item 3 times,
type 2 a plate with a repeated menu item and an additional menu item.
Then the total number of plates should be our answer from 4.3 plus the
number of plates with type 1 and number of plates with type 2.</p>
<p><strong>Type 1</strong> Counting the number of type 1 plates should
be fairly simple, if your plate only contains one menu item then there
should be one plate of this type for each of the menu items, therefore
there’s <span class="math inline">18</span> plates like this.</p>
<p><strong>Type 2</strong> Now for type 2, we can start by chossing two
items from the menu (there’s <span class="math inline">18 \choose
2</span> ways to do that) then from here note that you need to choose
which item you are going to repeat because depending on which one you
choose to double you get a different plate (there’s <span class="math inline">2</span> options to double), then you should also
consider the order but you should realize that no matter how you arange
the item on your plate you are just getting rotations of the same plate,
therefore your total number of plates of type 2 is <span class="math inline">2 \cdot {18 \choose 2}</span></p>
<p>Lastly, just add both the plates of type 1 and type 2, and that’s the
number you need to add to your answer from 4.3. <strong>Answer</strong>:
<span class="math inline">2 \cdot {18 \choose 2} + {18 \choose
1}</span></p>

<p>The key to solving this problem is the note “When there are multiple
pieces of a given color and type (for example, <span class="math inline">8</span> white pawns), we will assume they are
<strong>indistinguishable</strong> from one another.” This means we
count each type of chess piece for the colors black and white. There are
<span class="math inline">6</span> different types of chess pieces:
pawn, bishop, knight, rook, queen, and king. There are <span class="math inline">2</span> possible colors: black and white. This
means there are <span class="math inline">6 \cdot 2 = 12</span> unique
colored types of chess pieces.</p>
<p>There are <span class="math inline">12</span> options for the first
person, there are <span class="math inline">12</span> options for the

<p>We get <span class="math inline">\dfrac{8}{16}</span> from the fact

<p>Now we assume that we have a white pawn, meaning there are <span class="math inline">8-1=7</span> white pawns left and <span class="math inline">16 - 1 = 15</span> white chess pieces, which means
we have a <span class="math inline">\dfrac{7}{15}</span> chance for

<p>From here we simplify the answer by writing:</p>

<p>To answer this question we must determine how many
<strong>different</strong> pieces each person can choose. In a complete
chess set we know that there’s pawns, knights, bishops, rooks, queens,
and kings. Then we also know that each of these pieces can be aither
black or white, therefore there’s a totoal of <span class="math inline">6 \cdot 2 = 12</span> different pieces. Notice that
a complete chess set has 32 total pieces, but there’s multiple
duplicates in those 32 pieces that is why we say there’s only 12
different pieces on a chess set.</p>
<p>Now since every person has their own chess set, we know that each of
them can get any of the 12 pieces, therefore if we do this with one
person there would be <span class="math inline">12</span> possible
outcomes, now if we do it with two persons the first person can get any
of the 12 pieces, but then for each piece that person 1 can choose
person 2 can choose from their 12 pieces, which means that in this case
there’s <span class="math inline">12 \cdot 12</span> outcomes. if we
keep doing this for n persons we’ll get that there’s <span class="math inline">12 \cdot \dots \cdot 12 = 12^n</span>.</p>

coin undefinetely, I expect to see heads <span class="math inline">\frac{1}{2}</span> of the time. Similarly when we
say that the probability of choosing a black pawn is <span class="math inline">\frac{1}{4}</span>, that means that if we were to do
the experiment undefinetely, we expect to choose a black pawn <span class="math inline">\frac{1}{4}</span> of the time, but it does not
matter if you are doing it undefinetly or if you have an infinete amount

<p>True</p>
<p>There are multiple ways to check the independence between two events,
in this case I will use the fact that two events (A and B) are
indepedent whenever <span class="math inline">P(A|B) = P(A)</span>.</p>
<p>No lets define A as the event where you choose two pawns, and B as
the event of choosing two white pieces. Then if we have a white piece
the probability of that white piece being also a pawn would be <span class="math inline">\frac{8}{16}</span> because there’s 8 white pawns
and 16 white pieces total, thus if we know that we have another white
piece the probability for that piece to be also a pawn is <span class="math inline">\frac{8}{16}</span> again, Therefore $P(A|B) = ()^2
= $. Now the probability of having a pawn is <span class="math inline">\frac{16}{32}</span> because there’s 16 pawns and 32

<p>For making a meson, we need to choose two quarks. The first quark we
choose has <span class="math inline">6 \cdot 2 = 12</span> possibilities
because there are <span class="math inline">6</span> possible types and
<span class="math inline">2</span> possible states. However, our second
quark cannot have the same state as our first; so the second quark has
<span class="math inline">6 \cdot 1 = 6</span> possibilities because
there are still <span class="math inline">6</span> possible types, but
only <span class="math inline">1</span> possible state.</p>
<p>This means a single meson has <span class="math inline">12 \cdot 6 =
