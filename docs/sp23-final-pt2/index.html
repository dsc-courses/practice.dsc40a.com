<p>You run the <span class="math inline">k</span>-means clustering
algorithm on a dataset and it converges to a certain clustering with
associated inertia <span class="math inline">I</span>. You then
duplicate each data point in the dataset and run <span

with the same initial centroids as before. Which of the following is
true? <strong>Select all that apply.</strong></p>

<p>Bubbles 1 and 3: “The centroids found will be the same as before” and
“The inertia will be twice as much as before, <span class="math inline">2I</span>.”</p>
<p>The centroids found will be the same as before because the dataset
has been duplicated, but they have not moved! This means <span class="math inline">k</span> means clustering will find the same
clusters as before. You can imagine it like points overlapping each
other.</p>
<p>The inertia will be twice as much before <span class="math inline">2I</span> because of how inertia is calculated.
Recall inertia measures how well a dataset is clustered and is
calculated by measuring the distance between each data point and its
centroid, squaring the distance, and summing these squares across a
cluster. We have doubled our points! Since they did not move otherwise
the difference does not change, but we have twice as many points, which
will cause the inertia to double.</p>

<p>You roll a 12-sided die 8 times.</p>

<h3 id="problem-2.1">Problem 2.1</h3>
<p>What is the probability you roll 8 distinct values?</p>

\dfrac{12}{12}\cdot\dfrac{11}{12}\cdot\dfrac{10}{12}\cdot\dots\cdot\dfrac{5}{12}</span></p>
<p>There’s two ways you can think of this problem.</p>
<p>The numerator <span class="math inline">{12 \choose 8}\cdot8!</span>
is the number of total possible permutations of 8 distinct values; <span class="math inline">{12 \choose 8}</span> possible sets of 8 distinct
values times <span class="math inline">8!</span> orderings, because the
die could roll the same set of distinct values in <span class="math inline">8!</span> different ways. The denominator <span class="math inline">12^8</span> is the number of total possible
outcomes. Altogether, dividing the numerator by the denominator gives us
the probability of rolling 8 distinct values.</p>
<p>We can also solve this problem differently by realizing that the
rolls are independent. In the first roll the probability of getting a
new number is 1 (since any number would be new), now in the second roll
the probability of getting a new number is <span class="math inline">\frac{11}{12}</span> since we’ve only rolled one
number so rolling any of the other 11 numbers would be rolling a new
number.If you keep doing this for each roll, and multiply the
independent probabilities of getting a new number in each of the rolls
you’ll get <span class="math inline">\dfrac{12}{12}\cdot\dfrac{11}{12}\cdot\dfrac{10}{12}\cdot\dots\cdot\dfrac{5}{12}</span></p>

<h3 id="problem-2.2">Problem 2.2</h3>
<p>What is the probability you roll exactly 7 distinct values?</p>

<p><span class="math inline">\dfrac{{8 \choose 2}\cdot{12 \choose
7}\cdot7!}{12^8}</span></p>
<p>Again, I’m going to show you two different ways you can think of this
problem. We can get the total number of outcomes that get you exactly 7
distinct values by doing the following, first choose 7 from the 12
possible numbers (there’s <span class="math inline">{12 \choose
7}</span> ways to do it), then choose a number to duplicate (there’s
<span class="math inline">{7 \choose 1}</span> ways to do that), lastly
you need to order them. From the 8 possible places you have availible
you need to choose 2 for the repeated value (there’s <span class="math inline">{8 \choose 2}</span> ways to do that), then once you
chose a placement for your reapeted value you need to choose one for
each of the remaing 6 values(there’s <span class="math inline">6!</span>
ways to do that). Finally just multiply the different ways you can
perform each of those actions and you’ll get the number of ways you can
roll 7 different values <span class="math display">\begin{align*}
{12 \choose 7}\cdot{7 \choose 1}\cdot{8 \choose 2}\cdot6! = {8 \choose
2}\cdot{12 \choose 7}\cdot7!
\end{align*}</span></p>
<p>lastly, just divide by the total number of possible outcomes and you
get <span class="math inline">\dfrac{{8 \choose 2}\cdot{12 \choose
7}\cdot7!}{12^8}</span></p>
<p>You could also find the number of rolls with exactly 7 different
values by doing the following. First, select an ordered string of size 7
from the 12 possible values (there’s <span class="math inline">{12
\choose 7}\cdot7!</span> ways to do that), then take the first value of
the string as the duplicated value and keep the others as they are, now
you only need to place 2 copies of the repeated value somewhere on your
string of 6 numbers (there’s <span class="math inline">{8 \choose
2}</span> ways to do that), multiply this the ways you can do these two
actions and divide by total number of outcomes and you’ll get <span class="math inline">\dfrac{{8 \choose 2}\cdot{12 \choose
7}\cdot7!}{12^8}</span> This solution is faster but less intuitive.</p>

<p><span class="math inline">P(A|(B \cap C))</span> and <span class="math inline">P((A \cap C)|(B \cap C))</span></p>
<p>Recall the formula for conditional probability is <span class="math inline">P(A|B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)}</span>. We are
going to use this fact to figure out which of the following are the same
as <span class="math inline">P((A\cap B)|(B \cap C))</span>.</p>
<p>We should first expand <span class="math inline">P((A\cap B)|(B \cap
C))</span> by doing: <span class="math inline">P((A\cap B)|(B \cap C)) =
\frac{P(A \cap B) \cap P(B \cap C)}{P(B \cap C)}</span>. We can further
simplify the numerator to be <span class="math inline">(A \cap B) \cap
(B \cap C) \rightarrow A \cap B \cap C</span>. This means we get <span class="math inline">P((A\cap B)|(B \cap C))</span> by doing: <span class="math inline">P((A\cap B)|(B \cap C)) = \frac{P(A \cap B \cap
C)}{P(B \cap C)}</span>.</p>
<p>Now we can go through each of the options and figure out if, when put
inside the formula for conditional probability, we get <span class="math inline">\frac{P(A \cap B \cap C)}{P(B \cap C)}</span>.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><span class="math inline">P(A|(B \cap C))</span> <span class="math display">P(A|(B \cap C)) = \frac{P(A)P(B \cap C)}{P(B \cap

<p><br/></p>
<p><span class="math inline">P(A \cap B \cap C)</span></p>
<p>We can see that there is no way for this to equal <span class="math inline">\frac{P(A \cap B \cap C)}{P(B \cap C)}</span>
because it is missing the denominator.</p>
<p><br/> <span class="math inline">P((B \cap C)|(A \cap B))</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">P((B \cap C)|(A \cap B)) = \frac{P(B \cap

<p>Let’s now look at the right side of <span class="math inline">P((A

<p><span class="math display">P(A|(B \cap C))*P(B) = \frac{P(A)P(B \cap

\frac{P(A \cap B \cap C) * P(B)}{P(B \cap C)}</span></p>
<p>Now we can look at them together! <span class="math inline">\frac{P(A
\cap B \cap C)}{P(C)} = \frac{P(A \cap B \cap C) * P(B)}{P(B \cap
C)}</span>. We can cross multiply to clear the fractions: <span class="math inline">P(A \cap B \cap C) * P(B \cap C) = P(A \cap B \cap
C) * P(B) * P(C)</span>. Assuming that <span class="math inline">P(A
\cap B \cap C) \neq 0</span> we can divide both sides by <span class="math inline">P(A \cap B \cap C)</span>. We end up with <span class="math inline">P(B \cap C) = P(B) * P(C)</span>, which demonstrates
to us that <span class="math inline">B</span> and <span class="math inline">C</span> are independent of one another.</p>

<p>At Panda Express, there are <span class="math inline">18</span> items
available on the menu. Food is served on plates that are divided into
three equal sections, and all sections of the plate must contain exactly
one menu item.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h3 id="problem-4.1">Problem 4.1</h3>
<p>Suppose each section of the plate is a different color (in a
clockwise order around the plate, the sections are red, yellow, blue).
How many different-looking plates of food can be created, if we must
have three different menu items on the plate?</p>

<p>This problem is exactly asking for the number of permutations of
three elements from a pool of 18 elements, which is <span class="math display">\begin{align*}
18\cdot17\cdot16 = \frac{18!}{15!} = {18 \choose 3} \cdot 3!

<p>You should remember that whenever you draw items <strong>without
replacement</strong> and the <strong>order matters</strong> then you are
calculating a permutation. Alternatively, you can reason that in the red
segment of the plate, you can have any of the 18 different menu items,
then for the yellow segment you only have 17 menu items available, since
the red already has one, lastly you have 16 items left for the blue part
of the plate. Then just multiply all the ways you can choose menu items
for each segment getting a total of <span class="math display">\begin{align*}

how we explained the question before this one, aske your self if the

<p>One example plate of food has, in a clockwise order around the plate,
Eggplant Tofu, Broccoli Beef, and fried rice. This is the same plate as
the one that has, in a clockwise order, Broccoli Beef, fried rice, and

<p><span class="math inline">2 \cdot {18 \choose 3}</span></p>
<p>Similarly to how we solved the previous problems, we are going to
deconstruct the process of building a plate with the given
characteristics. First, we know that any plate must have three items, so
let’s start by choosing three items from the 18 menu items we have
available (we have <span class="math inline">{18 \choose 3}</span> ways
to do that).</p>
<p>Now once you chose the menu items that go on your plate, you need to
arange them on your plate, normally if we are aranging three distinct
elements on a line we know that there’s <span class="math inline">3!</span> ways to do that, unfortunately like we saw
in the prompt of this problem we need to account for when we rotate the
plate. In the prompt it was signaled that the plate with Eggplant Tofu,
Broccoli Beef, and fried rice in clockwise order around the plate, is
the same as the plate with Broccoli Beef, fried rice, and Eggplant Tofu
(also in clockwise order), this happens because if you rotate your fisrt
plate in counter clockwise direction then you would get the second
plate, and in fact we could do this again to show those two plates are
the same as the plate with fried rice, Eggplant Tofu, and Broccoli Beef.
If you were to do the rotation again you would get the original plate,
so for any specific plate we can find three different lines that
describe the same plate, thus if we divide the number of ways to order
our 3 menu items on a line(<span class="math inline">3!</span>) by 3, we
should get the number of different plates we can build with any three
items, so <span class="math inline">\frac{3!}{3} = 2</span></p>
<p>Finally we only need to mutiply the number of ways we can choose
three menu items by the number of plates we can build with those three
items getting <span class="math inline">2 \cdot {18 \choose
3}</span>.</p>

<h3 id="problem-4.4">Problem 4.4</h3>
<p>Suppose each section of the plate is the same color (white). Now we’d
like to consider what happens if we can have the same food in multiple
sections. What do we need to <strong>add to 4.3’s answer</strong> to get
the number of different-looking plates of food that can be created, if
we are allowed to have the same food in multiple sections?</p>
<p>As before, two plates that can be rotated to look like one another
count as the same.</p>

<h1 class="title"> </h1>
</header>
<p><span class="math inline">2 \cdot {18 \choose 2} + {18 \choose
1}</span></p>
<p>Now that we are allowed to repeat menu items we need to consider the
2 new types of plates, type 1 a plate with the same menu item 3 times,
type 2 a plate with a repeated menu item and an additional menu item.
Then the total number of plates should be our answer from 4.3 plus the
number of plates with type 1 and number of plates with type 2.</p>
<p><strong>Type 1</strong> Counting the number of type 1 plates should
be fairly simple, if your plate only contains one menu item then there
should be one plate of this type for each of the menu items, therefore
there’s <span class="math inline">18</span> plates like this.</p>
<p><strong>Type 2</strong> Now for type 2, we can start by chossing two
items from the menu (there’s <span class="math inline">18 \choose
2</span> ways to do that) then from here note that you need to choose
which item you are going to repeat because depending on which one you
choose to double you get a different plate (there’s <span class="math inline">2</span> options to double), then you should also
consider the order but you should realize that no matter how you arange
the item on your plate you are just getting rotations of the same plate,
therefore your total number of plates of type 2 is <span class="math inline">2 \cdot {18 \choose 2}</span></p>
<p>Lastly, just add both the plates of type 1 and type 2, and that’s the
number you need to add to your answer from 4.3. <strong>Answer</strong>:
<span class="math inline">2 \cdot {18 \choose 2} + {18 \choose
1}</span></p>

<p>You want to use a Naive Bayes classifier to predict whether you’ll be
successful in seeing the Milky Way under the following conditions:</p>
<ul>
<li>the setting is urban,</li>
<li>the season is winter, and</li>
<li>the time is late night.</li>
</ul>
<p>Naive Bayes predicts that, under these conditions, the probability
you are unsuccessful is <span class="math inline">k</span> times the
probability you are successful, for an integer value of <span
class="math inline">k</span>. What is <span
class="math inline">k</span>?</p>

<p>According to the Naive Bayes formula we will be solving these
equations: <span class="math display">\begin{align*}
&amp;P(\text{successful}|\text{urban, winter, late night})\\ &amp;=
P(\text{successful}) * P(\text{urban}|\text{successful}) *
P(\text{winter}|\text{successful}) * P(\text{late

&amp;P(\text{unsuccessful}|\text{urban, winter, late night}) \\
&amp;= P(\text{unsuccessful}) * P(\text{urban}|\text{unsuccessful}) *
P(\text{winter}|\text{unsuccessful}) * P(\text{late
night}|\text{unsuccessful})
\end{align*}</span></p>
<p>This means we need to calculate our prior probabilities <span class="math inline">P(\text{successful})</span>, <span class="math inline">P(\text{unsucessful})</span>, <span class="math inline">P(\text{urban}|\text{successful})</span>, <span class="math inline">P(\text{urban}|\text{usuccessful})</span>, <span class="math inline">P(\text{winter}|\text{successful})</span>, <span class="math inline">P(\text{winter}|\text{unsuccessful})</span>, <span class="math inline">P(\text{late night}|\text{successful})</span>, and
<span class="math inline">P(\text{late
night}|\text{unsuccessful})</span>.</p>
<p>We can calculate <span class="math inline">P(\text{successful})</span> by looking at the number
of successful outcomes from all possible outcomes. We find <span class="math inline">P(\text{successful}) = \frac{4}{12} =
\frac{1}{3}</span>.</p>
<p>Similarily we can calculate <span class="math inline">P(\text{unsucessful})</span>. <span class="math inline">P(\text{unsucessful}) = \frac{8}{12} =
\frac{2}{3}</span>.</p>
<p>We can now calculate <span class="math inline">P(\text{urban}|\text{successful})</span> by looking
at how many settings are urban when the outcome is successful. <span class="math inline">P(\text{urban}|\text{successful}) =
\frac{1}{4}</span>.</p>
<p>Similarily we can calculate <span class="math inline">P(\text{urban}|\text{unsuccessful})</span>. <span class="math inline">P(\text{urban}|\text{unsuccessful}) =
\frac{3}{8}</span>.</p>
<p>Following this same pattern we will find:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">P(\text{winter}|\text{successful}) =
\frac{3}{4}</span></p>
<p><span class="math inline">P(\text{winter}|\text{unsuccessful}) =
\frac{4}{8} = \frac{1}{2}</span></p>
<p><span class="math inline">P(\text{late night}|\text{successful}) =
\frac{2}{4} = \frac{1}{2}</span></p>
<p><span class="math inline">P(\text{late night}|\text{unsuccessful}) =
\frac{6}{8} = \frac{3}{4}</span></p>
<p>From here all we need to do is plug our prior probnabilities into the
equations we made earlier and solve!</p>
<p><span class="math display">\begin{align*}
&amp; P(\text{successful}|\text{urban, winter, late night})\\&amp;=
P(\text{successful}) * P(\text{urban}|\text{successful}) *
P(\text{winter}|\text{successful}) * P(\text{late
night}|\text{successful})\\
&amp;= \frac{1}{3} * \frac{1}{4} * \frac{3}{4} * \frac{1}{2}\\
&amp;= \frac{1}{32}

<p>and</p>
<p><span class="math display">\begin{align*}
&amp; P(\text{unsuccessful}|\text{urban, winter, late night}) \\ &amp;=
P(\text{unsuccessful}) * P(\text{urban}|\text{unsuccessful}) *
P(\text{winter}|\text{unsuccessful}) * P(\text{late

&amp;= \frac{2}{3} * \frac{3}{8} * \frac{1}{2} * \frac{3}{4}\\
&amp;= \frac{3}{32}
\end{align*}</span></p>
<p>We are told in the problem that “the probability you are unsuccessful
is <span class="math inline">k</span> times the probability you are
successful.”</p>
<p>This means <span class="math inline">k * \frac{1}{32} =

<p>Suppose UCSD implements a new graduation requirement for data science
majors. All data science majors must submit a list of English words they
can make using the letters of “Halicioglu”. When these lists are
collected, it is determined that:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">200</span> people included the word “hall”
on their list.</li>
<li><span class="math inline">100</span> people included the word
“chill” on their list.</li>
<li><span class="math inline">25</span> people included the word
“logical” on their list.</li>
<li><span class="math inline">60</span> people did not include any of
“hall”, “chill”, or “logical” on their list.</li>
<li><span class="math inline">80</span> people included both “hall” and

<li><span class="math inline">15</span> people included both “chill” and

<p>This problem requires us to the the principle of inclusion-exclusion
for three sets. For this problem lets define the following sets:</p>
<ul>
<li>Let <span class="math inline">H</span> be the set of people who
included “hall” on their list</li>
<li>Let <span class="math inline">C</span> be the set of people who
included “chill” on their list</li>
<li>Let <span class="math inline">L</span> be the set of people who
included “logical” on their list</li>
</ul>
<p>We are told:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">|H| = 200</span></li>
<li><span class="math inline">|C| = 100</span></li>
<li><span class="math inline">|L| = 25</span></li>
<li><span class="math inline">|H \cap C| = 80</span></li>
<li><span class="math inline">|C \cap L| = 15</span></li>
<li><span class="math inline">|H \cap L| = 20</span></li>
<li><span class="math inline">|H \cap C \cap L| = 10</span></li>
<li><span class="math inline">|H' \cap C' \cap L'| =
60</span>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">H'</span> means “not <span class="math inline">H</span>”</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Recall the principle of inclusion-exclusion for three sets follows:
<span class="math display">|H \cup C \cup L| = |H| + |C| + |L| - |H \cap
C| - |C \cap L| - |H \cap L| + |H \cap C \cap L|</span></p>
<p>We can simply plug and chug into the equation: <span class="math inline">|H \cup C \cup L| = 200 + 100 + 25 - 80 - 15 - 20 +
10 = 220</span>. This means the number of data science majors who
submited words “hall,”chill,” and “logical” is 220. But this is not all
data science majors!</p>
<p>We need to add in the number of data science majors who did not
submit any of those words in their list, which we are told is <span class="math inline">60</span> students. This means the number of data
science majors is <span class="math inline">220  + 60 = 280</span>.</p>
