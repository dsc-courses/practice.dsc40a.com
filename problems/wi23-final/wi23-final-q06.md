In the above figure $S$ is the sample space. Two events are denoted by
two circles: $A$ (Red + Blue) and $B$ (Green + Blue). Which area denotes
the event $\bar{A}\cap\bar{B}$?

1.  Orange stripes

2.  Red stripes

3.  Green stripes

4.  Blue stripes

4in Orange stripes. $\bar{A}$ is green and orange $\bar{A}$ is red and
orange Therefore $\bar{A}\cap\bar{B}$ is orange stripes.

\[4 points\] Use law of total probability to prove De Morgan's law:
$P(\bar{A}\cap\bar{B})=1-P(A\cup B)$. You may use the figure above to
visualize the statement but the proof has to use law of total
probability to be considered for points.

6in $$P(A\cup B)=P({A}) + P({B}) - P(A\cap B)=$$
$$=P({A}) + P(A\cap B)+(\bar{A}\cap B) - P(A\cap B)=$$
$$=P({A}) + P(\bar{A}\cap B) =$$ $$=1-P(\bar{A})+ P(\bar{A}\cap B) =$$
$$=1-P(\bar{A}\cap B)-P(\bar{A}\cap \bar{B}) + P(\bar{A}\cap B) =$$
$$1-P(\bar{A}\cap\bar{B})$$

Therefore $P(\bar{A}\cap\bar{B})=1-P(A\cup B)$.

Note this is similar to the review quesiton solved in class in week 10.
