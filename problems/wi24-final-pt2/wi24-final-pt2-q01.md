Consider an experiment where each of $n$ people selects
one piece from their own set of 32 chess pieces, uniformly at random.
The **result** of the experiment is a description of the **colors and
types** of the pieces each person selected. For example, if $n=3$, one
possible result is:

-   Person 1 selected a white knight.

-   Person 2 selected a black queen.

-   Person 3 selected a black pawn.

# BEGIN SUBPROB

How many results are possible for this experiment with $n$
people?

( ) $2^n$
( ) $6^n$
( ) $12^n$
( ) $16^n$
( ) $32^n$
( ) None of the above.

# BEGIN SOLUTION

$12^n$

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB

# BEGIN SUBPROB

As $n$ becomes large, what fraction of n people has selected a black pawn? Choose the answer that's closest to the actual fraction.

( ) 1/32
( ) 1/12
( ) 1/4
( ) 1/2
( ) None of the above.

# BEGIN SOLUTION

1/4

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB # BEGIN SUBPROB

True or False: Having two pawns is **independent** of having
two white pieces.

( ) True
( ) False

# BEGIN SOLUTION

True

# END SOLUTION
