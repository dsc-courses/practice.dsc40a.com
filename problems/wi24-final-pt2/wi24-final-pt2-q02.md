You run the $k$-means clustering algorithm on a dataset
and it converges to a certain clustering with associated inertia $I$.
You then duplicate each data point in the dataset and run $k$-means
again on this twice-as-big dataset, with the same initial centroids as
before. Which of the following is true? **Select all that apply.**

[ ] The centroids found will be the same as before.
[ ] The inertia will be the same as before, $I$.
[ ] The inertia will be twice as much as before, $2I$.
[ ] None of the above.

# BEGIN SOLUTION

The centroids found will be the same as before.

The inertia will be twice as much as before, $2I$.

# END SOLUTION
