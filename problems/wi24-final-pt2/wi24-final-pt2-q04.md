In hospital, there are 10 patients who have recently been exposed to COVID. The hospital purchased a new COVID testing machine. The machine could comprehensively analyze multiple body measurements to produce a COVID score for each patient, ranging from 1 to 10. According to the instruction manual of the machine, a higher COVID score means the patient is more likely to be infected by COVID, while a lower COVID score means the patient is less likely to be infected. The COVID score of each patient is listed below:

| **Patient Number** |  1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 |
|--------------------|--------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|--------|
| **COVID Score**    | 7      | 9     | 9     | 3     | 5     | 4     | 6     | 1     | 8     | 2      |


Suppose Patient 1, Patient 2, Patient 3, and Patient 4 are actually infected by COVID, while all other patients are not infected.

Based on the patient's COVID score, Dr. Issac uses a threshold of 2.5 to diagnose COVID. That means, he diagnose all patients with COVID Score above 2.5 to be COVID-infected, and all patient with Diagnostic Score below 2.5 to be non-infected. What is the True Positive (TP), True Negative (TN), False Positive (FP), and False Negative (FN) of Dr. Issac’s diagnose? Each block should be filled with an integer.

Dr. Albert is somewhat skeptical about technology, leading him to adopt a cautious approach in diagnosing patients. Initially, he sets a diagnostic threshold at 5.5. Patients scoring above this threshold are initially diagnosed as positive. However, Dr. Albert conducts a secondary diagnosis for all patients who received a positive diagnosis initially. During this secondary diagnosis, he reclassifies Patient 9's positive diagnoses as negative. What is the True Positive (TP), True Negative (TN), False Positive (FP), and False Negative (FN) of Dr. Albert’s diagnose? Each block should be filled with an integer.
