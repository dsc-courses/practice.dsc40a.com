 Consider the following four hypothesis functions:

\begin{itemize}
    \item $H_1(x) = H(x) = w_0 + w_1 x^2$
    \item $H_2(x) = w_0$
    \item $H_3(x) = w_0 + w_1 x$
    \item $H_4(x) = w_0 + w_1x + w_2x^2$
\end{itemize}

Let $H_1^*$, $H_2^*$, $H_3^*$, and $H_4^*$ be the versions of all four hypothesis functions that are using optimal parameters. In the subparts below, fill in the blanks.
