Let $\{(x_i,y_i)\}_{i=1}^n$ be a dataset of scalar input-output pairs, and consider the simple linear regression model

$$
f(a, b;\, x) = ax + b,\qquad a, b\in\mathbb{R}.
$$

Let $\gamma > 0$ be a fixed constant which is understood to be separate from the training data and the weights. Define the $\gamma$-risk according to the formula

$$
R_{\gamma}(a, b) = \gamma a^2 + \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - (ax_i + b))^2.
$$

Find closed-form expressions for the global minimizers $a^\ast, b^\ast$ of the $\gamma$-risk for the training data $\{(x_i,y_i)\}_{i=1}^n$. In your solution, you should clearly label and explain each step.
