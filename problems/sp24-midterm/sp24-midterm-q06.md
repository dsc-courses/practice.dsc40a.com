Consider the following four hypothesis functions:


-  $H_1(x) = H(x) = w_0 + w_1 x^2$
-  $H_2(x) = w_0$
-  $H_3(x) = w_0 + w_1 x$
-  $H_4(x) = w_0 + w_1x + w_2x^2$


Let $H_1^*$, $H_2^*$, $H_3^*$, and $H_4^*$ be the versions of all four hypothesis functions that are using optimal parameters. In the subparts below, fill in the blanks.

# BEGIN SUBPROB

The mean squared error of $H_1^*$ is \_\_\_\_ the mean squared error of $H_2^*$.

( ) Greater than
( ) Greater than or equal to
( ) Equal to
( ) Less than
( ) Less than or equal to
( ) Impossible to tell

# BEGIN SOLUTION

Less than or equal to

$H_1^*$ is a more flexible version of $H_2^*$ â€“ anything $H_2^*$ can do, $H_1^*$ can also do, so $H_1^*$ can't have a higher MSE than $H_1^*$.
