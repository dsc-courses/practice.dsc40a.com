# BEGIN PROB

\[(5 points)\] Suppose you randomly select 2 pieces from a set of 32
chess pieces, **without replacement**.

# BEGIN SUBPROB

(3 points) You glance at the pieces just long enough to see that both
pieces are white. What is the probability that you have 2 pawns?

# BEGIN SOLUTION

$\dfrac{8}{16}*\dfrac{7}{15} = \dfrac{C(8,2)}{C(16, 2)} = \dfrac{\frac{8}{32}*\frac{7}{31}}{\frac{16}{32}*\frac{15}{31}} = \dfrac{7}{30}$

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB

# BEGIN SUBPROB

(2 points) True or False: Having two pawns is **independent** of having
two white pieces.

( ) True
( ) False

# BEGIN SOLUTION

True.

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB
