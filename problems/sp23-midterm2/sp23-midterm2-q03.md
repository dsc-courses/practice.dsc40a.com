# BEGIN PROB

\[(9 points)\] In this problem, a **lineup** is a way of arranging items
in a straight line.

# BEGIN SUBPROB

(3 points) A chess player lines up all 16 **white pieces** from the set
of chess pieces. How many different-looking lineups can be created?
Remember, some pieces look the same.

$\dfrac{16!}{8!2!2!2!} = \dfrac{P(16,8)}{2^3} = C(16, 8)*C(8, 2)*C(6, 2)*C(4, 2)*C(2, 1)*C(1, 1)$

(3 points) A chess player lines up all 16 **pawns** from the set of
chess pieces. How many lineups have white pawns on both ends?

# BEGIN SUBPROB

(3 points) A chess player lines up all 16 **pawns** from the set of
chess pieces. Assuming that each different-looking lineup is equally
likely, what is the probability that the lineup has two of the
same-colored pawns on both ends (both black or both white)?

# BEGIN SOLUTION

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB

( ) $\frac{1}{4}$

( ) $\frac{1}{2}$

( ) $\frac{7}{30}$

( ) $\frac{7}{15}$

( ) None of the above.
