Suppose you have a dataset 
$$\{(x_1, y_1), (x_2,y_2), \dots, (x_8, y_8)\}$$ 
with $n=8$ ordered pairs such that the variance of $\{x_1, x_2, \dots, x_8\}$ is 50. Let $m$ be the slope of the regression line fit to this data.

Suppose now we fit a regression line to the dataset
$$\{(x_1, y_2), (x_2,y_1), \dots, (x_8, y_8)\}$$ 
where the first two $y$-values have been swapped. Let $m'$ be the slope of this new regression line.

If $x_1 = 3$, $y_1 =7$, $x_2=8$, and $y_2=2$, what is the difference between the new slope and the old slope? That is, what is $m' - m$? The answer you get should be a number with no variables.

**Hint:** There are many equivalent formulas for the slope of the regression line. We recommend using the version of the formula without $\overline{y}$.
