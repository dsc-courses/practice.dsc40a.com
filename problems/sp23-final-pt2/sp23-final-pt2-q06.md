<i>Originally Problem 6 on the Spring 2023 Final Part 2</i>

Suppose UCSD implements a new graduation requirement for
data science majors. All data science majors must submit a list of
English words they can make using the letters of "Halicioglu". When
these lists are collected, it is determined that:

-   200 people included the word "hall" on their list.

-   100 people included the word "chill" on their list.

-   25 people included the word "logical" on their list.

-   60 people did not include any of "hall", "chill", or "logical" on
    their list.

-   80 people included both "hall" and "chill" on their list.

-   15 people included both "chill" and "logical" on their list.

-   20 people included both "hall" and "logical" on their list.

-   10 people included all three of "hall", "chill", and "logical" on
    their list.

How many data science majors submitted a list?
