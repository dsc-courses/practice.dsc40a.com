Consider three events $A, B,$ and $C$ in the same sample space.

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Which of the following is equivalent to
$P((A\cap B)|(B \cap C))$? **Select all that apply.**

[ ] $P(A|(B \cap C))$
[ ] $P(A \cap B \cap C)$
[ ] $P((B \cap C)|(A \cap B))$
[ ] $P((A \cap C)|(B \cap C))$
[ ] None of the above.

# BEGIN SOLUTION

$P(A|(B \cap C))$ and $P((A \cap C)|(B \cap C))$

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Suppose $P((A \cap B)|C) = P(A|(B \cap C))*P(B)$. Which of
the following pairs of events **must be independent**?

( ) $A, B$
( ) $A, C$
( ) $B, C$
( ) None of the above.

# BEGIN SOLUTION

$B, C$

# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB
