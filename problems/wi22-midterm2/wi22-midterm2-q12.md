<i>Originally Problem 12 on the second Midterm of Winter 2022</i>

Your competitive family keeps track of their Stringle scores in a spreadsheet, where each column represents a different date, and each person in a the family records their scores in a different row. Suppose your family has 5 people, and you have kept track of Stringle scores for 50 days, so your spreadsheet has 5 rows and 50 columns. How many ways are there to organize the spreadsheet, if the rows can be in any order, but the columns must be in chronological order or reverse chronological order?

# BEGIN SOLUTION
