(1 point) For this problem, we'll say that there are six vowels: A, E, I, O, U, and Y. Consider the following three events:

-   $A$ is the event that today's Stringle string starts with a vowel.

-   $B$ is the event that today's Stringle string starts with a letter
    in the first half of the alphabet (A through M, inclusive).

-   $C$ is the event that today's Stringle string does not start with a
    Z.

Which of the following is true?

( ) $A$ and $B$ are independent. $A$ and $B$ are conditionally
independent given $C$.\
( ) $A$ and $B$ are independent. $A$ and $B$ are conditionally dependent
given $C$.\
( ) $A$ and $B$ are dependent. $A$ and $B$ are conditionally independent
given $C$.\
( ) $A$ and $B$ are dependent. $A$ and $B$ are conditionally dependent
given $C$.\
( ) None of the above.

# BEGIN SOLUTION

$A$ and $B$ are independent. $A$ and $B$ are conditionally dependent given $C$.

# END SOLUTION
