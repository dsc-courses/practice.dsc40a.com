# BEGIN PROB

(1 point) Suppose you apply $k$-means clustering to the data in your
family's Stringle score spreadsheet by representing the entries in each
column of the spreadsheet as a vector in $\mathbb{R}^5$. If we run the
algorithm with $k=2$, which of the following is the best description of
what the clusters represent?

( ) One cluster represents the Stringle strings that were easier to
guess, and the other represents the Stringle strings that were harder to
guess.
( ) One cluster represents the family members who are better Stringle
players, and the other represents the family members who not as good.
( ) One cluster represents the Stringle strings that had duplicated
letters, and the other represents the Stringle strings that had distinct
letters.
( ) One cluster represents the family members who play Stringle more
often, and the other represents the family members who do not play as
often.

# BEGIN SOLUTION

One cluster represents the Stringle strings that were easier to
guess, and the other represents the Stringle strings that were harder to
guess.
