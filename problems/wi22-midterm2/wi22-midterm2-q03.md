# BEGIN PROB

What is the probability of today's Stringle string having
exactly one duplicate letter, like SYSTEM, BEFORE, or YELLOW?

( ) $\dfrac{P(26,5)*5!}{26^6}$\
( ) $\dfrac{C(26,5)*5!}{26^6}$\
( ) $\dfrac{C(6,2)*P(26, 5)}{26^6}$\
( ) $\dfrac{C(26,5)}{26^6}$\
( ) None of the above.

# BEGIN SOLUTION

$\dfrac{C(6,2)*P(26, 5)}{26^6}$

TODO
