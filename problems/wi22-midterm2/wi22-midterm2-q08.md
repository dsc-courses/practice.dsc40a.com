(1 point) For this problem, we'll say that there are six vowels: A, E,

-   ends with a vowel

-   first two letters are the same

$$\frac{6}{26}+\frac{6}{26}+\frac{1}{26} - \frac{6}{26}*\frac{6}{26}-\frac{6}{26}*\frac{1}{26} - \frac{6}{26}*\frac{1}{26}+\frac{6}{26}*\frac{6}{26}*\frac{1}{26} = 1 - \frac{20}{26}*\frac{20}{26}*\frac{25}{26}$$
