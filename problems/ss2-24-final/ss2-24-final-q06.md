\[(12 pts)\] Euchre is a card game popular in the Midwest United States
and is played with a partial deck of 24 cards: the 9, 10, Jack, Queen,
King, and Ace of all four suits (Hearts, Diamonds, Spades, Clubs). A
hand of cards in Euchre is 5 cards.

Assume cards are dealt by drawing at random **without replacement** from
the set of 24 possible cards. The order of cards in a hand does not
matter.

In this question, you may leave your answers unsimplified, in terms of
fractions, exponents, factorials, the permutation formula $P(n, k)$, and
the binomial coefficient ${n \choose k}$.

Euchre is played by four players, so when all cards are dealt, there are

four remaining cards are Jacks (the strongest card in Euchre)?
