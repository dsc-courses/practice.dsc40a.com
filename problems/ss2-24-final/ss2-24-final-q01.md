Which single element of the dataset would you change, and to what value,
to make $h^* = 4$ the single minimizing value for the following loss
function and corresponding empirical risk? Bubble in your choice of
$x_i$, if possible, and provide the new value of that $x_i$ in the box
below. If no such $x_i$ is possible, bubble in "Not possible\" and
explain why in the box below.
