Let $\vec{x} = \begin{bmatrix} x_1 \\ x_2 \end{bmatrix}$. Consider the
function $g(\vec{x}) = (x_1 - 3)^2 + (x_1^2 - x_2)^2$.

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Find $\nabla g(\vec{x})$, the gradient of $g(\vec{x})$, and use it to
show that
$\nabla g\left( \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \right) = \begin{bmatrix} -8 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}$.

We'd like to find the vector $\vec{x}^*$ that minimizes $g(\vec{x})$
using gradient descent. Perform one iteration of gradient descent by
hand, using the initial guess
$\vec{x}^{(0)} = \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}$ and the learning
rate $\alpha = \frac{1}{2}$. Show your work, and put a
$\boxed{\text{box}}$ around your final answer for $\vec{x}^{(1)}$.
