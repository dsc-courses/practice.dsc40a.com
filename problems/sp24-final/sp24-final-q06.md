Atlanta, Detroit, and Minneapolis are the three largest hub airports for
Delta Airlines. You survey a sample of $n$ students at UCSD, and find
that:

-   20 students have been to Atlanta.

-   16 students have been to Detroit.

-   10 students have been to Minneapolis.

-   1 student hasn't been to any of these three cities.

-   Of the 10 students who have been to Minneapolis, none have been to
    Detroit and 5 have been to Atlanta.

Suppose you select one student at random from your sample of $n$.

Suppose the event that the selected student has been to Atlanta and the
event that the selected student has been to Detroit are independent.

What is the value of $n$? Show your work, and put a $\boxed{\text{box}}$
around your final answer, which should be an **integer**.

Now, suppose the event that the selected student has been to Atlanta and
the event that the selected student has been to Detroit are not
independent, meaning that $n$ is no longer necessarily your answer from
part (a).

The event that the selected student has been to Atlanta and the event
that the selected student has been to Minneapolis are conditionally
independent given that the selected student **has not** been to Detroit.

Now, what is the value of $n$?

Consider the events $A$, $D$, and $M$, defined as follows:

-   $A$: The event that the selected student has been to Atlanta.

-   $D$: The event that the selected student has been to Detroit.

-   $M$: The event that the selected student has been to Minneapolis.

Let $A^c$, $D^c$, and $M^c$ represent the complements of events $A$,
$D$, and $M$, respectively. (In class, we used $\bar{A}$ to represent
the complement, but that's hard to read on the exam.)

Which of the following combinations of sets form a partition of the
sample space?

( )

  -----
  $A$
  $D$
  $M$

( )

  -----------------------
  $A \cap D^c \cap M^c$

  $A \cap D$

  $A^c \cap D \cap M^c$

  ------------
  $A^c$
  $A \cap D$
  $A \cap M$
  ------------

( ) None of the above.
