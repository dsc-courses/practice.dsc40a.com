Delta has released a line of trading cards. Each trading card has a
picture of a plane and a color. There are 12 plane types, and for each
plane type there are three possible colors (gold, silver, and platinum),
meaning there are 36 trading cards total.

Now, suppose that each time you board a flight, a pilot hands you 1 card
drawn at random from the set of possible cards. You fly 9 times, which
gives you **9** cards drawn at random **with replacement** from the set
of possible cards.

In this question, you may leave your answers unsimplified, in terms of
fractions, exponents, the permutation formula $P(n, k)$, and the
binomial coefficient ${n \choose k}$.

Given that you receive a gold-colored card at least once, what is the
probability that you receive a gold-colored card exactly 5 times? Show
your work, and put a $\boxed{\text{box}}$ around your final answer.

The *Airbus A350*, the *Boeing 767*, and the *Airbus A330* are 3 of the
12 plane types that Delta made trading cards for.

What is the probability that you receive 2 *Airbus A350* cards, 4
*Boeing 767* cards, and 3 *Airbus A330* cards? Show your work, and put a
$\boxed{\text{box}}$ around your final answer.
