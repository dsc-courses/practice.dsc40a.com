Delta has released a line of trading cards. Each trading card has a
picture of a plane and a color. There are 12 plane types, and for each
plane type there are three possible colors (gold, silver, and platinum),
meaning there are 36 trading cards total.

After your next flight, a pilot hands you a set of **6** cards, drawn at
random **without replacement** from the set of 36 possible cards. The
order of cards in a set does not matter.

In this question, you may leave your answers unsimplified, in terms of
fractions, exponents, the permutation formula $P(n, k)$, and the
binomial coefficient ${n \choose k}$.
