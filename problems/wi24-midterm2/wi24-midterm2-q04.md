The standard acceleration of gravity $g$ is a universal constant of nature. That means $g=9.80665$ across the entire universe. It is also known that:

    $$G = m \times g$$

Where $G$ is the weight of an object and m is the mass of an object. Issac is interested in measuring g. He prepared a dumbbell with mass 10 in his garage and measured the weight of it 3 times. The measured weight is 102, 98, 100

# BEGIN SUBPROB
Calculate the mean value of $g$ Issac measured.

# BEGIN SUBPROB
After his measurement, an alien from the Frequentist Galaxy visited Issac's garage. Alien from Frequentist Galaxy could only understand frequentist statistics. Explain to the alien why Issac's measurement deviates from $g=9.80665$ (Hint: verbal explanation is enough, no equation is needed).

# BEGIN SOLUTION
Frequentist does not assign probability to hypothesis, so g is always equal to 9.80665 and it does not change. Issac's measurement deviate from the actual g value because of uncertainties in the measurement.
# END SOLUTION

# END SUBPROB

# BEGIN SUBPROB
After the first alien left, another alien from the Bayesian galaxy arrived. This alien told Issac: "I think g could take any value: it could be 1, could be 10, could be 100". Using the Bayes equation and Issac's measurement, convince the alien that g should be close to 10.

# BEGIN SOLUTION
The Bayes equation reads:

$$Posterior = \frac{Prior\times Likelihood}{Evidence}$$

The alien provides a uniform prior, or P(Hypothesis). They assume g could take many different possible values. However, the likelihood term is P(Data|Hypothesis). For the hypothesis of g = 1, since it does not agree with data, the likelihood is very low and thereby does not contribute to posterior; the same argument hold for g = 100. Only when g=10 will the likelihood be high.
