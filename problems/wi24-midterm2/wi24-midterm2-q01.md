\[(6 points)\] Quarks is one of the smallest fundamental particles in
physics. There are 6 types of quarks: up, down, top, bottom, strange,
charm. Each one of the 6 quarks can be in two state: quark or antiquark.

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Consider an experiment where we select n quarks uniformly at random. The
**result** of the experiment is a description of the **type and state**
of the quark selected. For example, if $n=3$, one possible result is:

-   Selected quark 1 is a top quark.

-   Selected quark 2 is a charm antiquark.

-   Selected quark 3 is a top antiquark.

How many results are possible for this experiment with $n$ quarks?

( ) $6^n$
( ) $9^n$
( ) $12^n$
( ) $18^n$
( ) $36^n$
( ) None of the above.

A meson is formed by combining two quarks. In order to form a meson, the
two quarks must satisfy the following rules:

-   They must be in **different state**: one must be quark and the other
    one must be anti-quark

-   The two quarks can be the **same type**: i.e. top quark and top
    antiquark can form a meson

-   The **order** of quark and antiquark does matter.

Consider an experiment where we select n mesons uniformly at random. How
many results are possible for this experiment?

( ) $2^n$
( ) $6^n$
( ) $12^n$
( ) $18^n$
( ) $36^n$
( ) None of the above.
