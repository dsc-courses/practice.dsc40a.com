<!-- Probability / Sample Space-->

There were 70 farmers in a La Jolla farmers market last week. We know
that 52 of them farm arugula, 20 farm beets, 14 farm carrots, 8 farm
arugula and carrots, 8 farm beets and carrots, and 6 farm arugula and
beets.

We pick a farmer uniformly at random. Determine the probability of this
particular farmer farms all three crops, i.e., arugula, beets, and
carrots.
