# BEGIN PROB

<!-- Probability -->

We have three boxes containing white
and black balls. The first box has 3 white and 2 black balls, the second
box has 2 white and 3 black balls, and, the third box has 4 white and 1
black balls. We pick a box uniformly at random and pick a ball from it.
We observe that the ball is white. What is the probability that it came
from the third box, i.e., what is the probability of the third box was
picked at the beginning?
